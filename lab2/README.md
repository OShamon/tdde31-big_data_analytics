# The lab report
The report should contain the following three files:

* An PDF file with a picture of the EER diagram (task 1).
* A text file (or a PDF file) with notes regarding the additional choices and
assumptions you have made when creating your EER diagram.
* An PDF file with a picture of the diagram that presents your relational
database schema (task 2).

Place these three file into the gitlab folder.

## EER-diagram
If you want to use some software for drawing diagrams, notice that this folder contains an **XML file** of the EER-diagram used as an simple example for this lab assignment. Download this file and upload it to [draw.io](https://www.draw.io).
Next, make your changes in draw.io and when you are finished, export the diagram as a pdf file which you add it to your lab report.

If downloading it doesn't work to the following: 

1. go to draw.io website, press create new diagram
2. draw your ER diagram using the shapes in the drop-down menu 'Entity relation'
3. name the file ER.xml and save it where you want

## Text file
If you make choices and add constraints for aspects that are not explicitly specified in the given data
requirements, clearly write down the choices and assumptions that you make.


## Relational Model (RM) 
In addition to the XML file with the EER-diagram, this folder contains another XML file with an example diagram that represents the relational schema.
You will have to complete the relations by yourselves. Use draw.io as before and export the final diagram as pdf file for your lab report.
